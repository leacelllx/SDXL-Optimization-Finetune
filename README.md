Running Fine-Tuning Scripts
   ```
The repository also provides scripts for fine-tuning the SDXL model on custom datasets.

## Prepare Your Dataset:

Organize your dataset into appropriate directories.
Ensure data is preprocessed as required.
Fine-Tune SDXL Model:

   ```bash
python scripts/fine_tune_sdxl.py --config configs/fine_tuning_config.json
   ```
Evaluate Fine-Tuned Model:

   ```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py --model fine_tuned_model.pth
   ```



## Optimization Techniques
This project explores several optimization strategies:

- **Precision Reduction** : Implementing FP16 to reduce memory usage.
```bash 
python optimize_sdxl.py --config configs/optimization_config.json --precision
```
- Efficient Attention Mechanisms: Utilizing memory-efficient attention to enhance performance.

- **Layer Pruning** : Removing redundant layers to streamline the model.
```bash 
 python optimize_sdxl.py --config configs/optimization_config.json --attention --pruning
```
- **Knowledge Distillation** : Transferring knowledge from larger models to smaller ones.

#### to apply all at once 
```bash
python optimize_sdxl.py --config configs/optimization_config.json --all
```


## Fine-Tuning Techniques
This project also delves into fine-tuning methods to adapt the SDXL model to specific tasks or datasets:

- **DreamBooth**: A technique to personalize text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion using a few images of a subject. [Learn more](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/README_sdxl.md)

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that adjusts the cross-attention layers where images and prompts intersect. [Learn more](https://huggingface.co/blog/sdxl_lora_advanced_script)

- **Textual Inversion**: A method that trains a new token concept in the text embedding space without modifying model weights. [Learn more](https://replicate.com/guides/stable-diffusion/fine-tuning)


## Benchmarks
Performance benchmarks are provided to demonstrate the impact of each optimization and fine-tuning technique. Results include metrics such as inference time, memory consumption, and output quality.

## Image Generation:
If you want to try some of my prompts to generate images you can run 
```bash
python optimize_sdxl.py --generate
```
