# Optimization Techniques

## Precision Reduction

- **Description**: Reduces the numerical precision of model calculations (e.g., from FP32 to FP16) to decrease memory usage and potentially increase computational speed.
- **Benefits**: Lower memory consumption, faster computations.
- **Trade-offs**: Possible minor loss in model accuracy.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes PyTorch's `.half()` method to convert model parameters to FP16.

## Efficient Attention Mechanisms

- **Description**: Implements memory-efficient attention algorithms to enhance model performance.
- **Benefits**: Improved speed and reduced memory usage during attention operations.
- **Trade-offs**: May require additional dependencies or compatibility considerations.
- **Implementation**: Integrates libraries like xformers for efficient attention.

## Layer Pruning

- **Description**: Removes redundant or less important layers or neurons from the model to streamline its architecture.
- **Benefits**: Reduced model size and inference time.
- **Trade-offs**: Potential loss of model capacity and accuracy.
- **Implementation**: Applies pruning techniques to eliminate specified percentages of model parameters.
